# ✅ Regular Execution Credit Deduction - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 What Was Updated

The regular (non-debug) execution mode now deducts credits correctly:

1. ✅ **Architecture cost** deducted at start
2. ✅ **Per-cycle credits** deducted during execution
3. ✅ **Correct architecture costs** (I=5, II=100, III=500, IV=1000)
4. ✅ **Out-of-credits detection** during execution

## 📝 Changes Made to `RunServlet.java`

### Change 1: Fixed Architecture Costs (Lines 237-250)

**Before**:

```java
case "I": return 10;   // ❌ Wrong
case "II": return 20;  // ❌ Wrong
case "III": return 30; // ❌ Wrong
case "IV": return 40;  // ❌ Wrong
```

**After**:

```java
case "I": return 5;      // ✅ Correct
case "II": return 100;   // ✅ Correct
case "III": return 500;  // ✅ Correct
case "IV": return 1000;  // ✅ Correct
```

### Change 2: Added Architecture Cost Logging (Line 140)

```java
System.out.println("[CREDIT] Deducted architecture cost: " + archCost + " credits for " + request.username);
```

### Change 3: Added Per-Cycle Credit Deduction (Lines 347-361)

**Added in execution loop**:

```java
while (currentIndex < instructions.size()) {
    // Check if user has enough credits for this cycle
    ServerState.UserRecord user = serverState.getUser(session.username);
    if (user == null || user.credits < 1) {
        session.state = "ERROR";
        session.error = "Out of credits! Execution stopped at cycle " + session.cycles;
        break;
    }

    // Deduct 1 credit per cycle
    if (!serverState.deductCredits(session.username, 1)) {
        session.state = "ERROR";
        session.error = "Failed to deduct credit for cycle";
        break;
    }

    // Execute the instruction...
}
```

## 🔄 Complete Regular Execution Flow

```
1. User clicks "Start Regular" on Architecture III
   ↓
2. Client sends: POST /api/run/start
   { arch: "III", ... }
   ↓
3. Server validates user has credits
   ├─ Total needed: 500 (arch) + estimated cycles
   └─ Has enough? Continue
   ↓
4. Server deducts 500 credits (Architecture III cost)
   ↓
5. Server creates run session
   ↓
6. Server starts execution in background thread
   ↓
7. For each instruction:
   ├─ Check user has >= 1 credit
   ├─ Deduct 1 credit
   ├─ Execute instruction
   └─ Continue
   ↓
8. If credits run out:
   ├─ Set state to "ERROR"
   ├─ Set error: "Out of credits!"
   └─ Stop execution
   ↓
9. Client polls /api/run/status
   ├─ See ERROR state
   └─ Show alert to user
```

## 💰 Cost Examples for Regular Execution

### Example 1: Simple Program on Architecture I

```
Architecture Cost: 5 credits
Program executes 15 cycles: 15 credits
Total: 20 credits
```

### Example 2: Medium Program on Architecture II

```
Architecture Cost: 100 credits
Program executes 25 cycles: 25 credits
Total: 125 credits
```

### Example 3: Complex Program on Architecture III

```
Architecture Cost: 500 credits
Program executes 40 cycles: 40 credits
Total: 540 credits
```

### Example 4: Advanced Program on Architecture IV

```
Architecture Cost: 1000 credits
Program executes 75 cycles: 75 credits
Total: 1075 credits
```

## 📊 Server Console Output

During regular execution, you'll now see:

```
[CREDIT] Deducted architecture cost: 500 credits for alice
[CREDIT] Run stopped - User out of credits: bob
```

Or for successful runs, the credits are deducted silently during execution.

## ⚖️ Debug vs Regular Execution

| Feature           | Debug Mode           | Regular Mode          |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Architecture cost | ✅ 5/100/500/1000    | ✅ 5/100/500/1000     |
| Deducted when     | On start             | On start              |
| Per-cycle cost    | ✅ 1 credit per step | ✅ 1 credit per cycle |
| Deducted when     | Each "Step Over"     | Automatically in loop |
| Out-of-credits    | ✅ Returns error     | ✅ Sets ERROR state   |
| User isolation    | ✅ Per user          | ✅ Per user           |
| Logging           | ✅ Console logs      | ✅ Console logs       |

**Result**: Both modes now work **identically** for credit management! 🎉
