DEPLOYMENT TESTING STEPS
================================================================================

Step 1: Deploy Server
  1. Copy s-emulator.war to {TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps/
  2. Start/restart Tomcat
  3. Wait for auto-deployment
  4. Verify: http://localhost:8080/s-emulator should show index page

Step 2: Run Client
  1. From SUBMISSION directory, double-click run.bat
     (Or run from command line: run.bat)
  2. Client should start and show login screen
  3. Login with any username

Step 3: Verify Connectivity
  1. After login, dashboard should load
  2. User list should appear (with your username)
  3. Can upload programs
  4. Can execute and debug programs
  5. Chat functionality works

Server (s-emulator.war):
- Java Version: 17
- Servlet API: Jakarta Servlet 6.0 (Tomcat 10.1+)
- Build Tool: Maven 3.x
- Dependencies: All bundled in WEB-INF/lib
- Architecture: REST API + WebSocket for real-time updates

Client (s-client/):
- Java Version: 17
- UI Framework: JavaFX 21
- HTTP Client: OkHttp 4.12.0

- Platform: Windows (native libraries included)
- Batch file: run.bat with classpath auto-configuration

================================================================================
WHAT WAS CONFIGURED
================================================================================

Server POM (s-server/pom.xml):
- Maven WAR plugin configured to include all dependencies
- Packaged s-engine-core as dependency (not provided)
- Packaged gson as dependency
- Only jakarta.servlet-api marked as provided (Tomcat has it)

Client POM (s-client/pom.xml):
- Maven JAR plugin with manifest classpath
- Maven Dependency plugin to copy all JARs to lib/
- Maven Assembly plugin to create distribution
- Assembly descriptor created at src/assembly/distribution.xml

Client Batch File (run.bat):
- Auto-detects Java installation
- Builds classpath from main JAR + all lib/*.jar
- Uses delayed expansion for proper classpath handling
- Launches with main class: com.semulator.client.Main

Server Configuration:
- Base URL in ApiClient.java: http://localhost:8080/s-emulator/api
- Matches WAR finalName: s-emulator
- No environment-specific configuration needed

================================================================================
BUILD COMMANDS USED
================================================================================

To rebuild from source:

1. Navigate to project root:
   cd C:\Users\user\IdeaProjects\S-emulator

2. Clean and build everything:
   mvn clean package

3. Outputs created:
   - s-server/target/s-emulator.war
   - s-client/target/s-client.zip
   - s-client/target/s-client/ (directory)

4. Submission package assembled from:
   - WAR: s-server/target/s-emulator.war
   - Client: s-client/target/s-client/s-client/

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- The WAR file is completely self-contained with all dependencies
- The client is completely self-contained with all dependencies
- No external configuration files needed
- Assumes standard Tomcat installation on localhost:8080
- Assumes Java 17+ installed and in PATH for client
- Client tested on Windows (batch file and JavaFX natives for Windows)
- For non-Windows deployment, would need different JavaFX natives

================================================================================
SUBMISSION READY: ✓
================================================================================

All requirements met. Package is ready for submission.

To submit:
1. Copy entire SUBMISSION folder, OR
2. Copy s-emulator.war and s-client folder separately

Both the WAR and client directory can be tested independently.
